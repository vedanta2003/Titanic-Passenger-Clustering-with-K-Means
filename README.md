## Introduction

The Titanic Passenger Clustering project applies K-Means clustering to the Titanic dataset to discover patterns and group passengers based on certain features. The main goals are to:

1. Preprocess the data by handling missing values and scaling features.
2. Utilize the K-Means algorithm to cluster passengers into groups.
3. Visualize the clusters for both the training and test datasets.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- numpy
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib numpy
```

You should also have Jupyter Notebook installed. If not, you can install it using:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

## Usage

Follow these steps to use the code:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vedanta2003/Titanic-Passenger-Clustering-with-K-Means.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Titanic-Passenger-Clustering-with-K-Means
   ```

3. Start Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open the `KMeans_Clustering_Titanic.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook.

5. Run the code cells within the notebook to perform K-Means clustering on the Titanic passenger data and view visualizations of the clusters.

## Code Structure

The project's directory structure is as follows:

- `KMeans_Clustering_Titanic.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and explanations.
- `data/`: Directory containing the Titanic passenger data files.

## Results

After running the code within the notebook, you will obtain visualizations that show how passengers are clustered based on age, fare, and other features. You can analyze these clusters to gain insights into the data.
