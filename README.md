## Introduction

The Titanic Passenger Clustering project applies K-Means clustering to the Titanic dataset to discover patterns and group passengers based on certain features. The main goals are to:

1. Preprocess the data by handling missing values and scaling features.
2. Utilize the K-Means algorithm to cluster passengers into groups.
3. Visualize the clusters for both the training and test datasets.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- numpy

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib numpy
```

## Usage

Follow these steps to use the code:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. Run the code:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

The code will perform K-Means clustering on the Titanic passenger data and display visualizations of the clusters.

## Code Structure

The project's directory structure is as follows:

- `main.py`: Main script to run the K-Means clustering on Titanic data.
- `preprocessing.py`: Contains data preprocessing steps using scikit-learn transformers.
- `visualization.py`: Includes functions for generating cluster visualizations.
- `data/`: Directory containing the Titanic passenger data files.

## Results

After running the code, you will obtain visualizations that show how passengers are clustered based on age, fare, and other features. You can analyze these clusters to gain insights into the data.
